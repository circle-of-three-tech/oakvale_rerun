            <p>Across Africa, graduates are emerging from universities with strong academic credentials but limited readiness for the professional world. This is not a talent problem — it is a curriculum design problem. We work with faculties and institutions to close it.</p>
            <p>Our academic partnerships range from curriculum review and redesign through to the co-development of new qualifications, executive education programmes and continuous professional development frameworks.</p>
