            <h2>The capability gap is <em>your competitive risk.</em></h2>
            <p>Across Africa&apos;s fastest-growing sectors, the organisations that will outperform are those that invest in building internal capability now. Not through one-off training days, but through structured, sustained programmes that change how people work.</p>
            <p>We partner with corporates at every stage of growth — from the high-growth startup building its first management layer to the established business redesigning its leadership pipeline for the next decade.</p>
