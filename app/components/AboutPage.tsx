                Oakvale Learning grew out of more than a decade of workforce
                development work in health and social care — one of the most
                demanding, highest-stakes sectors in the world. The rigour,
                contextual sensitivity and commitment to real-world outcomes
                that this sector demands became the foundation of everything we
                do.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
                We recognised that the quality of learning available to African
                workforces was not keeping pace with the ambition of the
                organisations and people we were working with. Too much of what
                passed for &ldquo;training&rdquo; was generic, extractive and
                disconnected from real-world application.
              </p>
              <p>
                We set out to do something different: high-quality, globally
                relevant learning, designed from the ground up for African
                realities, delivered with the rigour of the sectors where the
                stakes are highest.
